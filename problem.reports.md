# How to report problems with workstations

## With calculations ...

There are pieces of information we need to solve almost every problem.

- Your name, as it appears in UR's documentation. 
- Your `netid`. It can be difficult to figure out when it is something
    like `ae9qg`.
- Time the problem happened. Use "15:40, April 29", not "Yesterday afternoon 
    just before I left.
- Name of the workstation, or if the problem involved interaction between
    workstations, the names of all the workstations involved.
- Explain what you were doing. 
    - Which program you were running, including the full version. Ex: "Columbus 7.2.2"
    - The complete names of the input files and result files. Hint: 
        You can get the complete name of a file with `realpath {filename}`.
    - Where were you logged in? Ex: "I was logged in at Erica's console," or 
        "I was ssh-ed into Kevin from my laptop."
    - Was your program being run interactively or from a script? What script?
